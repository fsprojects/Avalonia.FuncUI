If you run into problems in linux, you may need to install vlc and vlc dev related libraries
I tested building with these libs on Zorin 15 (Ubuntu 18.04)

```bash
apt-get install libvlc-dev.
apt-get install vlc
```

If you still have issues you can refer to this [guide](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/blob/3.x/docs/linux-setup.md)

**Note**: You don't need `LibVLCSharp.Gtk` nuget package to build this project.
